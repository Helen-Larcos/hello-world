# hello-world
My first repository
Hello out there!
this is Helen and my first attempt at using this platform.
I am the Channel Sales Manager for Asia & ANZ at GitHub Inc.
I love to travel, photography, food and wine and a good laugh with friends.
Look forward to hearing from developers out there with great ideas!
